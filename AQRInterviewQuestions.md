## Pre-screen code signal test
You will be given a list of stock prices for a given day and your goal is to return the maximum profit that could have been made by buying a stock at the given price and then selling the stock later on. For example if the input is: [45, 24, 35, 31, 40, 38, 11] then your program should return 16 because if you bought the stock at $24 and sold it at $40, a profit of $16 was made and this is the largest profit that could be made. If no profit could have been made, return -1.

## Technical Round 1

6. What is the difference between GET and POST methods
7. How would you design a system that has some variables that needs to be changes frequently

## Technical Round 2

1. Given this link, make a call to it and get the JSON response and bind it to an object and print it like a string
2. Given a string, reverse only words of this string
ex. I Am Ramya => I mA aymaR
